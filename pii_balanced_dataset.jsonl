Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.

The patient was then discussed the risks, complications, and consequences of a surgical procedure and a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia.  The patient was placed on the operative table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient was then placed upon a shoulder roll.  After this, the skin incision was marked approximately two fingerbreadths above the sternal notch.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:1000 approximately 7 cc total.,After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a #10 blade was then utilized to make a skin incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was then bluntly dissected utilizing a Ray-Tec sponge and a bear claw was then utilized to retract the upper incisional skin with counter retraction performed to allow a subplatysmal plane of skin flaps to be performed in superior and inferolateral directions.  After this, the midline was then identified and grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps.  The raphe was noted and Bovie cauterization was utilized to cut down into this region.  The fine stats were utilized to further open this area with exposure and bisection of the sternothyroid muscle.  It was separated on the left side from the patient's sternothyroid muscle.  After this, the sternothyroid muscle was identified, grasped with the DeBakey forceps and infiltrated initially through its fascial plane with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Blunt dissection was then utilized to free the sternothyroid muscle from the thyroid gland in superior and inferior directions and laterally with the help of Kitners.  After this, the plane was rotated more anteriorly with the superior and inferior parathyroid glands identified.  The fat cap was noted to be attached on the superior parathyroid to the posterior aspect of the thyroid itself.  It was freed from the thyroid gland and reflected laterally and posteriorly.  The inferior parathyroid gland actually appeared to be attached also to the inferior aspect of the thyroid itself and was reflected laterally.  After this, the patient's thyroid gland was palpated noting a thyroid nodule in the posterior inferior aspect along with the calcification laterally.  The nodule appeared to be sort of rubbery in consistency and approximately 1 cm diameter.  As the gland was rotated more anteriorly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side was identified and further dissection along Berry's ligament on the medial aspect was performed.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid artery were both cauterized with a bipolar cautery and bisected.  After this, the gland was easily rotated anteriorly with further dissection carried up to the superior pole.  The superior pole was exposed with the help of a Richardson and Army-Navy retractors with cross-clamping and tying of the superior laryngeal artery and vein.  Further, the small bleeding vessels were identified and bipolared, and cut with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The superior pole was finally freed and the gland was rotated more anteriorly onto the anterior aspect of the trachea.  Berry's ligament was finally freed and the gland was cross-clamped on the opposing thyroid isthmus with a mosquito.  After this, the gland was cut with a Metzenbaum scissors and tied with a #3-0 undyed Vicryl tie.  The defect on the neck now was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  Surgicel was then cut in small strips and three replaced in the lateral part of the neck.,The opposing side of the thyroid gland on the right was palpated with no noticeable nodules or masses.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl on a SH, followed by reapproximation of the subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by reapproximation of the skin by running subcuticular #5-0 Prolene and a #6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips, and bacitracin were placed followed by a sterile 4 x 4 dressing.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room, and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and will be admitted to hospital for 23-hour observation and will be followed up in one week afterwards.\n\nWhat medical condition is the patient being treated for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient is being treated for a left thyroid mass, specifically a thyroid nodule located on the left anterior pole that was identified as a hot nodule on imaging studies."}]}

He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.

Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.  Of note, the patient received Angiomax during the procedure and an ACT above 300 was maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.,2.  High complex percutaneous coronary intervention of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal with Impella circulatory support.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The estimated blood loss was 200 ml.  Estimated dye used was 200 ml of Visipaque.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins.,PLAN:  ,1.  Aspirin, Plavix, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors as tolerated.,2.  Hydration.,3.  The patient will be observed over night for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia.

The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.  The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.,The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months.  The patient understood.  The patient was to follow up as an outpatient.\n\nWhat is the patient's phone number?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.\n\nWhen was this patient born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.,2.  Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:  ,The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,The lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.\n\nPlease provide the patient's address and date of birth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.

She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.  Consent was obtained for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4 cm incision was created in the midline above the xiphoid.  Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.,This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.

Angiographically the mid left anterior descending artery and distal left anterior descending artery demonstrates systolic compression of the vessel lumen, consistent with myocardial bridging.  The degree of myocardial bridging appears moderate in the mid vessel and mild in the distal segment.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of atherosclerotic obstruction.,4.  ,CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: , The circumflex gives rise to two large extremely tortuous marginal vessels that extend towards the apex.  Angiographically, the circumflex artery is normal.,CONCLUSION: , This is a 70-year-old female with above clinical and cardiovascular history, who has angiographic evidence of a large anterior apical and inferior apical wall motion abnormality with angiographically patent coronary arteries with two segments of myocardial bridging involving the mid and distal left anterior descending artery.  These angiographic findings are consistent with Takasubo syndrome, aka apical ballooning syndrome.

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right subclavian region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the left subclavian vein.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18-gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The needle was then removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was secured to the field.  A second #18 gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein and once again a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  Likewise, the needle was removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was then secured to the field.  Next, a #15-knife blade was used to make a 1 to 1.5 inch linear incision over the area.  A #11-knife blade was used to make a deeper incision.  Hemostasis was made complete.  The edges of the incision were grasped and retracted.  Using Metzenbaum scissors, dissection was carried down to the pectoralis muscle fascial plane.  Digital blunt dissection was used to make a pacemaker pocket large enough to accommodate the pacemaker generator.  Metzenbaum scissors were then used to dissect cephalad to expose the guide wires.  The guidewires were then pulled through the pacemaker pocket.  One guidewire was secured to the field.,A bloodless introducer sheath was then advanced over a guidewire into the vascular lumen under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  Next, a ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium.  The pacemaker lead was then placed in the appropriate position in the right ventricle.  Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  The lead was sewn at the pectoralis muscle plane using #2-0 silk suture in an interrupted stitch fashion around the ________.  Pacing and sensing threshold were then reconfirmed.  Next, a second bloodless introducer sheath was advanced over the second guidewire into the vascular lumen.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was passed into the right atrium.  The sheath was then turned away in standard fashion.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was then placed in the appropriate position.  Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  The lead was sewn to the pectoralis muscle facial plane utilizing #2-0 silk suture around the ________.  Sensing and pacing thresholds were then reconfirmed.  The leads were wiped free of blood and placed into the pacemaker generator.  The pacemaker generator leads were then placed into pocket with the leads posteriorly.

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.

Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation.  Respiratory rate is 17-20.  Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.,NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion.,HEART:  Regular.,ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.  He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.\n\nWhat tests or procedures are mentioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tests and procedures mentioned include a CT scan (performed on 11/02/07) that revealed pneumatosis coli, bilateral hydronephrosis, and liver lesions; an upper endoscopy that identified a small gastric ulcer; and a planned repeat CT scan to reassess the pneumatosis and liver lesions for potential changes or resolution."}]}

He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.\n\nWhat are the PII information of this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.

Limited left thoracotomy with partial pulmonary decortication and insertion of chest tubes x2.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy.  Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope.  Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems.  Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy.  He was properly draped.  I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.  Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest.  We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.  Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung.  We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.  Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure.  On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations.  We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex.,The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.  Then, the patient was transported.,Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.

After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6.  The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level.  There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases.  The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery.  There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation.  The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut.  A marker was placed.  This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion.  Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition.  Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4.  After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level.  We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid down.  An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur.  This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm.  The herniation was noted on the right.  However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left.  Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium.  X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter.  C-collar was placed.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.\n\nWhat are the physical exam findings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The document does not contain specific physical examination findings; it primarily details the patient’s diagnosis, surgical indications, procedure steps, and associated risks."}]}

After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia.  Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Antibiotics had been given prior to incision.  A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately there was  purulent material seen in the area.  Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets.  The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall.  There was quite a bit of local peritonitis.  The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch.  The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis.  The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology.,Then the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Initial labs were considered to be consistent with an obstructive pattern, so further imaging was obtained. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed lymphadenopathy and a markedly enlarged liver. His abdominal pain was controlled with mild narcotics and he was noted to have decreasing jaundice by hospital day 4. An US guided liver biopsy revealed only acute granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. The overall architecture of the liver was noted to be well preserved.,Gastroenterology was consulted for EGD and ERCP. The EGD was normal and the ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy without evidence of obstruction. In addition, they performed an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of two lymph-nodes, one in the subcarinal region and one near the celiac plexus. Again, pathologic results were insufficient to make a tissue diagnosis.,By the second week of hospitalization, the patient was having intermittent low-grade fevers and again experiencing night-sweats. He remained jaundice. Given the previous negative biopsies, surgery was consulted to perform an excisional biopsy of the right groin lymph node, which revealed no evidence of carcinoma, negative AFB and GMS stains and a single noncaseating granuloma.,By his fourth week of hospitalization, he remained ill with evidence of ongoing liver failure. Surgery performed an open liver biopsy and lymph node resection.,STUDIES (HISTORICAL):,CT abdomen: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes near the porta hepatis and peri-pancreatic regions.

We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He denies having any surgeries.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,MEDICATIONS:,  At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  He does take a multivitamin on occasion.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.

There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.\n\nWhat is the treatment plan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The treatment plan for this patient with stage IV metastatic non-small cell lung cancer involves initiating chemotherapy to manage symptoms and potentially prolong survival. The proposed regimen includes carboplatin and gemcitabine, with both medications administered on day 1 and an additional dose of gemcitabine on day 8. This cycle is to be repeated every 21 days, with a goal of completing six cycles, depending on the patient’s response and tolerance. Pain management is also a priority, and a pain consult has been ordered to optimize symptom control. Once pain is under control, the patient will be discharged from the hospital, and arrangements for outpatient follow-up and chemotherapy will be made."}]}

I used a total of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was evaluated preop and noted to be in stable condition.  Chart and informed consent were all reviewed preop.  All risks, benefits, and alternatives regarding the procedure have been reviewed in detail with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, recurrence of the lesion, need for further procedures have been all reviewed.  Each of these lesions appears to be benign nevi; however, they have been increasing in size.  The lesions involving the left upper and lower cheek appear to be deep.  These required standard excision with the smaller lesion of the right nasal ala being more superficial and amenable to a superficial shave excision.  Each of these lesions was marked.  The skin was cleaned with a sterile alcohol swab.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated.  Sterile prep and drape were then performed.,Began first excision of the left upper cheek skin lesion.  This was excised with the 15-blade full thickness.  Once it was removed in its entirety, undermining was performed, and the wound was closed with 5-0 myochromic for the deep subcutaneous, 5-0 nylon interrupted for the skin.,The lesion of the lower cheek was removed in a similar manner.  Again, it was excised with a 15 blade with two layer plastic closure.  Both these lesions appear to be fairly deep nevi.,The right nasal ala nevus was superficially shaved using the radiofrequency wave unit.  Each of these lesions was sent as separate specimens.  The patient was discharged from my office in stable condition.  He had minimal blood loss.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  Postop care instructions were reviewed in detail.

Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3.,2.  Spinal stenosis C3-C4.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3.,2.  Spinal stenosis C3-C4.,PROCEDURES,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy, C3-C4, C2-C3.,2.  Anterior cervical fusion, C2-C3, C3-C4.,3.  Removal of old instrumentation, C4-C5.,4.  Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.  He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form.\n\nWhat are the physical exam findings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The document does not include specific physical examination findings; it focuses on the diagnosis, surgical procedure, and intraoperative observations."}]}

Cheek, neck, and jowl lipotosis. Facial rhytides.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE: , Temporal cheek-neck facelift (CPT 15825).  Submental suction assisted lipectomy (CPT 15876).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 65-year-old female who has progressive aging changes of the face and neck.  The patient demonstrates the deformities described above and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, risks, limitations, and alternatives in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  The patient has consented to surgery.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started and anesthesia was maintained throughout the case.  The patient was monitored for cardiac, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.,The hair was prepared and secured with rubber bands and micropore tape along the incision line.  A marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incisions, which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus, the post-tragal region, the post auricular region and into the hairline.  In addition, the incision was marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift, then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift.  The incision was marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction.  The incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairline.,The areas to be operated on were injected with 1% Lidocaine containing 1:100,000 Epinephrine.  This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure was maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision was made, as previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors was used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnels from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula was then introduced along these previously outlined tunnels into the jowl on both sides and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnels were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inches of underwater mercury suction was accomplished in all tunnels.  Care was taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it was rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure was performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral areas were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat was then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border was cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl was placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap was then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut was used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound was cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape was placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minutes for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision was started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve was then made, and again the incision was carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicles and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision was carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision was made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair locations and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area was kept deep to the roots of the hair follicles and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle was continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection was brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerves and vessels in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flaps were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pass the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining was connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care was taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection was carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the areas of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis was obtained and all areas inspected.  At no point were muscle fibers or major vessels or nerves encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS was sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap was then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS was split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion was sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS was trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS was then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area was then inspected for any bleeding points and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flaps were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cuts were made and the suspension points in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so as not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scars in the healing period.  Skin closure was accomplished in the hairbearing areas with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area was closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut was used in the post auricular area as well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin was closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure was repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flaps were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid was expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain was placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing was cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze was used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This was wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex was secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branches of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to home in satisfactory condition.\n\nWhat medications is the patient currently taking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The medical record does not mention any current medications the patient is taking."}]}

The dura was perforated with a spinal needle.,A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed.  This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass.  Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted.  This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted.  This was irrigated and then CSF continued.  Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag.,Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding.\n\nDoes the patient suffer from any chronic illness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The medical record does not indicate that the patient suffers from any chronic illness.

Bilateral tubal ligation.,3.  Extensive anterior abdominal wall/uterine/bladder adhesiolysis.,ANESTHESIA:,  Spinal/epidural with good effect.,FINDINGS:  ,Delivered vigorous male infant from cephalic presentation.  Apgars 9/9.  Birth weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Infant suctioned with a bulb upon delivery of the head and body.  Cord clamped and cut and infant passed to pediatric team present.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.  Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall _______ into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries.  Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,URINE OUTPUT:  ,Per anesthesia records.  Urine cleared postoperatively.,IV FLUIDS:  ,Per anesthesia records.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal/epidural anesthesia.  She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.  Irrigation of the muscular layer with good hemostasis noted.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl in a running continuous closure.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated, additional hemostasis with Bovie cautery.  The skin was closed with staples.\n\nCan you extract all personal information from this record?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,\n\nWhat medical condition is the patient being treated for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient is being evaluated for persistent abdominal pain, possibly of gastrointestinal or urologic origin, and is currently being managed with MiraLax for bowel regulation while Detrol has been discontinued due to worsening symptoms.

Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000.  A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change.  There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was \"immune\" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.

His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness.  We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options.  Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections.  I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal.  Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break.  We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation.  I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone.  Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.  He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded.  Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case.  The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides.  A roll was placed between the shoulder blades.  The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion.  Ten pounds of traction was applied.  A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision.  The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle.  This was then split in line with its fibers.  Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized.  A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location.  The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit.  Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains.,Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes.  Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally.  Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression.  The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen.,A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace.  Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed.  The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field.  After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position.  There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace.  All weight was then removed from the crania tongs.,The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis.  Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5.  There was excellent purchase.  A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts.  The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase.,Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks.  The carotid pulse was strong.  A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware.  The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing.  The drain was hooked to bulb suction.  A Philadelphia collar was applied.,The cranial tongs were carefully removed.  The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone.  There was good hemostasis.,The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.\n\nCan you provide identifying details for this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.\n\nWhat is the patient's name?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

She sustained a right open ankle fracture, right femur fracture, right femoral neck fracture, right open knee, and right elbow abrasions.  Given the emergent nature of the right femoral neck fracture and her young age as well as the open fracture, it was decided to proceed with an urgent operative intervention.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail and the consents were signed.  The operative site was marked.  The patient was taken to the operating room where she was given preoperative clindamycin.  The patient had then general anesthetic performed by anesthesia.,A well-padded side tourniquet was placed.  Attention was turned to the right ankle first.  The large medical laceration was extended and the tissues were debrided.  All dirty of the all injured bone, muscle, and tissues were debrided.  Wound was then copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.  At this point, the medial malleolus fracture was identified and was reduced.  This was then fixed in with two 4.5 mm cannulated Synthes screws.,Next, the attention was turned to lateral malleolus.  Incision was made over the distal fibula.  It was carried down sharply through the skin in the subcutaneous issues.  Care was taken to preserve the superficial peroneal nerve.  The fracture was identified, and there was noted to be very comminuted distal fibula fracture.  The fracture was reduced and confirmed with fluoroscopy.  A 7 hole Synthes 3.5 mm locking plate was placed.  This was placed in a bridging fashion with three screws above and three screws below the fracture.  Appropriate reduction was confirmed under fluoroscopy.  A cotton test was performed, and the ankle did not open up.  Therefore, it was decided not to proceed with syndesmotic screw.,Next, the patient was then placed in the fracture table and all extremities were well padded.  All prominences were padded.  The right leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 2-cm incision was made just distal to the greater trochanter.  This was carried down sharply through the skin to the fascia.  The femur was identified.  The guidewire for a striker Asnis 6.5 mm screw was placed in the appropriate position.  The triangle guide was then used to ensure appropriate triangular formation of the remainder of the screws.  A reduction of the fracture was performed prior to placing all the guide wires.  A single 8 mm Asnis screw was placed inferiorly followed by two 6.5 mm screws superiorly.,Next, the abrasions on the right elbow were copiously irrigated.  The necrotic and dead tissue was removed.  The abrasions did not appear to enter the joints.  They were wrapped with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4 Kerlix and Ace wrap.,Next, the lacerations of the anterior knee were connected and were extended in the midline.  They were carried down sharply to the skin and the retinacular issues to the joint.  The intercondylar notch was identified.  A guide wire for the striker T2 retrograde nail was placed and localized with fluoroscopy.  The opening reamer was used following the bolted guide wire was then passed.  The femur was then sequentially reamed using the flexible reamers.  A T2 retrograde nail 10 x 340 was then passed.  Two 5 mm distal locking screws and two 5 mm proximal locking screws were then placed.,Prior to reaming and passing the retrograde nail, the knee was copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.  Any dead tissues in the knee were identified and were debrided using rongeurs and curettes.,The patient was placed in the AO splints for the right ankle.  The wounds were dressed with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4s and IO band.  The care was then transferred for the patient to Halstead Service.,The plan will be non-weightbearing right lower extremity and antibiotics for 48 hours.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entirety of the procedure.\n\nWhat are the PII information of this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.\n\nWhat are the PII information of this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

A time-out process was followed and antibiotics were given.,Then, both legs were prepped and draped in the usual fashion with the patient was in the supine position.  An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided.  Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen.  A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly.  Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.  The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory.  Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin.,Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.,Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL.

The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Tracheostomy.,2.  Thyroid isthmusectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal, less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.\n\nPlease provide the patient's address and date of birth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.\n\nWhen was this patient born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.\n\nWhat is the patient's phone number?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

The remaining nerves tested revealed normal distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, F-waves, and H. reflexes.,NEEDLE EMG:  Needle EMG was performed on the right arm and leg and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles and the left FDI.  It revealed 2+ spontaneous activity in the right APB and FDI and 1+ spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, lower and middle lumbosacral paraspinals, right extensor digitorum communis muscle, and right pronator teres.  There was evidence of chronic denervation in the right first dorsal interosseous, pronator teres, abductor pollicis brevis, and left first dorsal interosseous.,IMPRESSION:  This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  An active right C8/T1 radiculopathy.  Electrical abnormalities are moderate.,2.  An active right C6/C7 radiculopathy.  Electrical abnormalities are mild.,3.  Evidence of chronic left C8/T1 denervation.  No active denervation.,4.  Mild right lumbosacral radiculopathies.

She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.,Dilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  The vulva and perineum appeared normal.  Laparoscopic findings revealed normal appearing uterus, fallopian tubes bilaterally as well as ovaries bilaterally.  There was a functional cyst on the left ovary.  There was filmy adhesion in the left pelvic sidewall.  There were two clear lesions consistent with endometriosis, one was on the right fallopian tube and the other one was in the cul-de-sac.  The uterosacrals and ovarian fossa as well as vesicouterine peritoneum were free of any endometriosis.  The liver was visualized and appeared normal.

She recently had a spontaneous vaginal delivery in June and her family planning is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A bimanual exam was performed and the above findings were noted.  Prior to beginning the procedure, her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vagina and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum.  The cervix was dilated so that the uterine elevator could be placed.  Gloves were exchanged and attention was then turned to the anterior abdominal wall where the skin at the umbilicus was everted and using the towel clips, a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  The Veress needle was then inserted and using sterile saline ______ the pelvic cavity.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 bladed trocar was then placed and intraabdominal placement was confirmed with the laparoscope.  A second skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis and under direct visualization, a 7 mm bladed trocar was placed without difficulty.  Using the Hulka clip applicator, the left fallopian tube was identified, followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was then placed snugly against the uterus across the entire diameter of the fallopian tube.  A second Hulka clip was then placed across the entire diameter just proximal to this.  There was good hemostasis at the fallopian tube.  The right fallopian tube was then identified and followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was placed. snugly against the uterus across the entire portion of the fallopian tube in a 90 degree angle.  A second Hulka clip was placed just distal to this again across the entire diameter.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the abdomen was desufflated and after it was desufflated, the suprapubic port site was visualized and found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope and remaining trocars were then removed with good visualization of the peritoneum and fascia and the laparoscope was removed.  The umbilical incision was then closed with two interrupted #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The suprapubic incision was then closed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed and the single-toothed tenaculum site was found to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated that procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

The patient had tried nonoperative therapy, which did not assist the patient.  The patient had previous diagnosis of carpal tunnel and EMG showed compression of the right median nerve.  As a result of these findings, the patient was sent to my office presenting with this history and was carefully evaluated.  On initial evaluation, the patient had the symptomology of carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient at the time had the risks, benefits, and alternatives thoroughly explained to her.  All questions were answered.  No guarantees were given.  The patient had agreed to the surgical procedure and the postoperative rehabilitation as needed.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given sedation.  The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications.\n\nWhen was this patient born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Any type of rotation and pulling muscle did cause numbness of the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was initially seen by Dr. X on October 18, 2007, at the Occupational Health Facility.  He utilized a tennis elbow brace, but did continue to experience symptomatology into the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was placed on light duty for the next couple of months.  Mr. XXXX suffered another work injury to the right shoulder on October 11, 2007.  He did undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by Dr. Y in December of 2007.  Thereafter, he continued to work in a light duty type of basis for the next few months.,An EMG and nerve conduction study was performed in December of 2008, which demonstrated evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.  He was able to return to work doing more of a light duty type of position.,The injured worker has also seen Dr. Y once again subsequent to the EMG and nerve conduction study on December 3, 2008.  It was felt that the injured worker would benefit from decompression of the carpal tunnel and an ulnar nerve transposition.

She was found by EMS sitting on the toilet having diarrhea, and apparently had also just vomited. Upon my questioning of the patient, she can confirm that she has been sick to her stomach and has vomited. She cannot tell me how many times. She is also unable to describe the vomitus. She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Per the ER documentation is hypertension, diverticulosis, blindness, and sciatica.,MEDICATIONS:, Lorazepam 0.5 mg, dosing interval is not noted; Tylenol PM; Klor-Con 10 mEq; Lexapro; calcium with vitamin D.,ALLERGIES:, SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Unknown.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Also unknown.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Unobtainable secondary to the patient's condition.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Pulse 80. Respiratory rate 18. Blood pressure 130/80. Temperature 97.6.,GENERAL: Elderly black female who is initially sleeping upon my evaluation, but is easily arousable.,NECK: No JVD. No thyromegaly.,EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT: Her oropharynx is dry. Her hearing is very diminished.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rhythm. No lower extremity edema.,GI: Mild epigastric tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normoactive.,RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with a normal effort.,SKIN: Warm, dry, no erythema.,NEUROLOGICAL: The patient attempts to answer questions when asked, but is very hard of hearing. She is seen to move all extremities spontaneously.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:, White count 9.6, hemoglobin 15.9, hematocrit 48.2, platelet count 345, PTT 24, PT 13.3, INR 0.99, sodium 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 95, bicarb 20, BUN 54, creatinine 2.2, glucose 165, calcium 10.3, magnesium 2.5, total protein 8.2, albumin 3.8, AST 33, ALT 26, alkaline phosphatase 92. Cardiac isoenzymes negative x1. EKG shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 96 and a prolonged QT interval.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1. Pancreatitis. Will treat symptomatically with morphine and Zofran, and also IV fluids. Will keep NPO.,2. Diarrhea. Will check stool studies.,3. Volume depletion. IV fluids.,4. Hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether the patient is diabetic. I will treat her with sliding scale insulin.,5. Hypertension. If the patient takes blood pressure medications, it is not listed on the only medication listing that is available. I will prescribe clonidine as needed.,6. Renal failure. Her baseline is unknown. This is at least partly prerenal. Will replace volume with IV fluids and monitor her renal function.,7. Hypokalemia. Will replace per protocol.,8. Hypercalcemia. This is actually rather severe when adjusted for the patient's low albumin. Her true calcium level comes out to somewhere around 12. For now, I will just treat her with IV fluids and Lasix, and monitor her calcium level.,9. Protein gap. This, in combination with the calcium, may be suggestive of multiple myeloma. It is my understanding that the family is seeking hospice placement for the patient right now. I would have to discuss with the family before undertaking any workup for multiple myeloma or other malignancy.\n\nWhat is the patient's address?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.\n\nPlease provide the patient's address and date of birth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Colovesical fistula.,2.  Intraperitoneal abscess.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Exploratory laparotomy.,2.  Low anterior colon resection.,3.  Flexible colonoscopy.,4.  Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra.  The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization.\n\nWhat is the patient's address?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family.\n\nIs there any mention of family medical history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the record mentions that the patient’s aunt has a history of type II diabetes, but there is no family history of neuropathy, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases."}]}

Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago.  This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time.  She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms.  She is almost asymptomatic at present.  She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs.  She has had no associated weakness.,On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal.  The patient is obese.  There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities.  Strength is full and symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent.  Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced.  The right radial sensory response is normal.  The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal.  Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle.  Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.,IMPRESSION:  ,This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.,2.  Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies.  Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil.  I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return.  With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes.  However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following:  Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.\n\nList the patient's full name and contact information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007.  At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted.  When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine.  I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008.  According to his notes this went well.,According to the family, there has not been any improvement.,With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago.  He is virtually unable to walk at all.  He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.,He is completely incontinent.  He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go.  He wears a Depends undergarment all the time.,He has no headaches.,His thinking and memory are worse.  For the most part, he is apathetic.  He does not talk very much.  He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section.  He does have some daytime activities.  He takes a nap once a day.  He does not read very much.  On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  He needs full assistance at the nursing home.,MEDICATIONS:,  From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30.  He was not at all oriented.  He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor.  He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards.  He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall.  He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers.  I do not see any paraphasic errors.  There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  He is also stimulus bound.  There is a tendency to mimic.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  There is no upgaze that I can elicit today.  The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  This is a change from a year ago.  The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength.  The tone is characterized by paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.,Sensory Exam:  Intact to light touch.,Cerebellar Exam:  Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.,Gait:  Severely impaired.  When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side.  He cannot getup on his own.  He needs assistance.  Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago.  The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm.  The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Possible supranuclear palsy.,3.  Severe gait impairment.,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence.,5.  Dementia.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with him and his family.  Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again.  I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan.  His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection.\n\nWhat tests or procedures are mentioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tests and procedures mentioned include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, MRI scan of the cervical spine, cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), CT scan of the brain, and comparison with a prior MRI.

Open exploration of the left subclavian/axillary vein.,2.  Insertion of a double lumen port through the left femoral vein, radiological guidance.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was electively taken to the operating room, where he underwent a general anesthetic through his tracheostomy.  The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area.  There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It was done with radiological guidance.  Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium.  The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area.  The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution.  The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl.  Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers.  Dressings were applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent back to recovery room in satisfactory condition.\n\nWhen was this patient born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

However, based on the nerve conduction and EMG findings indicating decreased motor unit recruitment, positive waves, and fibrillations, the results are consistent with a diffuse motor neuron or axonal process. A neurologist would likely recommend further diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying cause (e.g., motor neuron disease, neuropathy) and may initiate supportive treatments such as physical therapy, medications for symptom management, and possibly referral to a neuromuscular specialist for ongoing care."}]}

The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints.  She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis.  She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for a chest port placement.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.  She does not know of what strength up to eight daily.  She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent.  She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily.,HABITS:,  She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years.  She drinks beer approximately twice daily.  She denies use of recreational drugs.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is married.  She lives with her spouse.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for two brothers and father who have cancer.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Significant mainly for her pain complaints.

No focal muscle weakness.  She is deconditioned.,Neurologic:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  The patient has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.,Spine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: , Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,INVESTIGATION: , She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.,2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.,3.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.\n\nWhat are the PII information of this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.,2.  Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left was 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings.  All questions answered.\n\nWhat is the treatment plan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The treatment plan includes hospitalization for 1 to 2 days for pain control and neurovascular monitoring following open reduction and internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle and closed reduction casting of the right forearm.

He is married, on medical leave from his job as a tree cutter, and lives with his wife and five children.,CHIEF COMPLAINT AND REACTION TO HOSPITALIZATION:  ,The patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment for dangerousness to others after repeated assaultive behaviors at Hospital Emergency Room, the morning prior to admission.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient was very sleepy this morning, only minimally cooperative with interview.  Additional information taken from the emergency room records that accompanied him from Hospital yesterday as well as from his wife, who I contacted by telephone.  The patient was apparently at his stable baseline when discharged from the Hospital on 01/21/10, status post back surgery following a work-related injury.  The patient returned to Emergency Room on the evening prior to admission complaining of severe back pain.  His ER course is notable for yelling, spitting, and striking multiple staff members.  The patient was originally to be admitted for pain control, but when he threatened to leave, he was referred to MHPs, who subsequently detained him for 72 hours for dangerousness to others.  On interview, the patient reports only hazy memories of these incidences and states this behavior was secondary to his pain and his medications.  He was contrite about the violence.  When his wife was contacted by telephone, she agreed with this assessment and reports that he has a history of domestic violence usually in the setting of alcohol and illicit substance intoxication, but denies any events in the last 3 years.,His wife reports that after discharge from the hospital, on 01/21/10, he was prescribed Percocet, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He essentially exhausted his approximately 10 days' supply of these agents on the morning of 01/23/10, and as above believes that this was responsible for his presentation yesterday.  She reports that she has been in contact with him since his arrival in our facility and reports that he is \"back to normal.\" She denies feeling that he currently represents a threat to her or her five children.  She was unaware of his mental health history, but denies that he has received care for any condition since they were married three years ago.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient has a history of Involuntary Treatment Act of 72 hours in our facility in 2004 or 2005 for assaultive behaviors; however, these records are not currently available for review.  The patient denies any outpatient mental health treatment before or since this hospitalization.  He describes his mental health diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder; however, he denies a history of dramatic mood swings in the absence of illicit substances or alcohol intoxication.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Notable for status post back surgery, discharged from Hospital on 01/21/10.,MEDICATIONS:,  From discharge from Hospital on 01/21/10, include Percocet, Valium, Soma, and Vistaril, doses and frequency are not currently known.  His wife reports that he was discharged with approximately 10 days' supply of these agents.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is employed as a tree cutter, currently on medical leave for the last 2 months following a back injury.  He lives with his wife and children.  He has a history of domestic violence, but not recently.  Other details of occupational, educational history not currently known.,SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY:,  Records indicate a previous history of methamphetamine and alcohol abuse/dependence.  The wife states that he has not consumed either since 12/07.  Of note, urine tox screen at Hospital was positive for marijuana.,LEGAL HISTORY:  ,The patient has been charged with domestic violence in the past, but his wife denies any repeat instances since in the last 3 years.  It is not known whether the patient is currently on probation.,GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Unknown.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,Attitude:  The patient is only minimally cooperative with interview secondary to being sleepy, and after repeated attempts to ask questions, he rolled over and went to bed.,Appearance: He is unkempt and there are multiple visible tattoos on his biceps.,Psychomotor:  There is no obvious psychomotor agitation or retardation.  There are no obvious extrapyramidal symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.,Affect:  His affect is notably restricted probably due to the fact that he is sleepy.,Mood:  Describes his mood as \"okay.\",Speech:  Speech is normal rate, volume, and tone.,Thought Processes:  His thought processes appear to be linear.,Thought Content:  His thought content is notable for his expressions of contrition about violence at Hospital last night.  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and date but not situation.  Attributes this to not really remembering the events at Hospital that resulted in this hospitalization.,Judgment and Insight:  His insight and judgment are both appear to be improving.,Assets:  Include his supportive wife and the fact he has been able to remain alcohol and methamphetamine sobriety for the last 3 years.,Limitations:  Include his back injury and possible need for improvement of health treatment engagement.,FORMULATION:  ,This is a 40-year-old white male, who was admitted for an acute agitation in the setting of misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He appears much improved from his condition at Hospital last night and I suspect that his behavior is most likely attributed to delirium and this since resolved.  He reports historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, however, the details of this diagnosis are not currently available for review.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Delirium, resolved (recent mental status changes likely secondary to misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, Valium, and hydroxyzine.)  Rule out bipolar affective disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  Chronic pain status post back surgery.,AXIS IV:  Appears to be moderate.  He is currently on medical leave from his job.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning is currently 50 (his GAF was 20 approximately 24 hours ago).,ESTIMATED LENGTH OF STAY:,  Three days.,PLAN:,  I will hold psychiatric medications for now given the patient's fairly rapid improvement as he cleared from the condition, I suspect is likely due to misuse of prescribed medications.  The patient will be placed on CIWA protocol given that one of the medications he overused was Valium.  Of note, he does not currently appear to be withdrawing and I anticipate that his CIWA will be discontinued prior to discharge.  I would like to increase the database regarding the details of his historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder before pursuing referrals for outpatient mental health care.

A lid speculum was applied to the right eye, and a stab incision into the anterior chamber was done close to the limbus at about the 1 o'clock position with a Superblade, and Xylocaine 1% preservative free 0.25 mL was injected into the anterior chamber, which was then followed by Healon to deepen the anterior chamber. Using a keratome, another stab incision was done close to the limbus at about the 9 o'clock position and with the Utrata forceps, anterior capsulorrhexis was performed, and the torn anterior capsule was totally removed. Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were performed with the tuberculin syringe filled with BSS. The tip of the phaco unit was introduced into the anterior chamber, and anterior sculpting of the nucleus was performed until about more than two-thirds of the nucleus was removed. Using the phaco tip and the Drysdale hook, the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces and then phacoemulsified.,The phaco tip was then exchanged for the aspiration/irrigation tip, and cortical materials were aspirated. Posterior capsule was polished with a curette polisher, and Healon was injected into the capsular bag. Using the Monarch intraocular lens inserter, the posterior chamber intraocular lens model SN60WF power +19.50 was placed into the inserter after applying some Healon, and the tip of the inserter was gently introduced through the cornea tunnel wound, into the capsular bag and then the intraocular lens was then inserted inferior haptic first into the back and the superior haptic was placed into the bag with the same instrument. Intraocular lens was then rotated about half a turn with a collar button hook. Healon was removed with the aspiration/irrigation tip, and balanced salt solution was injected through the side port to deepen the anterior chamber. It was found that there was no leakage of fluid through the cornea tunnel wound. For this reason, no suture was applied.

The patient was given antibiotics preoperatively.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating suite and placed in supine position on the operating table.  She was placed in the seated position and a spinal anesthetic was placed, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was then moved to supine position again and a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the right thigh.  Right lower extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All extremities were padded prior to this.,The right lower extremity, after being prepped and draped in the sterile fashion, the tourniquet was elevated and maintained for less than 60 minutes in this case.  A midline incision was made over the right knee and medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  Patella was everted.  The infrapatellar fat pad was incised and medial and lateral meniscectomy was performed and the anterior cruciate ligament was removed.  The posterior cruciate ligament was intact.,There was severe osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment on the lateral femoral condyle as well as mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial femoral compartment as well severe osteoarthritis along the patellofemoral compartment.  The medial periosteal tissue on the proximal tibia was elevated to the medial collateral ligament and medial collateral ligament was left intact throughout the entirety of the case.,At the extramedullary tibial guide, an extended cut was made adjusting for her alignment.

He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.,He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was \"rebuilt.\" He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.,MEDICATIONS:, His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, \"natural\" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.,MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.,CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.,NECK: His neck was supple.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.,CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.,BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:, MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.,LABORATORY: ,His initial labs were unremarkable.,IMPRESSION: ,Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.,PLAN:, Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem.

She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and \"complete resection\" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia.

Right orchiopexy.,2.  Right herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Sac.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis.  The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.

Already, de-torsed bilateral testes fixation and bilateral appendix testes cautery.,ANESTHETIC:,  A 0.25% Marcaine local wound insufflation per surgeon, 15 mL of Toradol.,FINDINGS:,  Congestion in the left testis and cord with a bell-clapper deformity on the right small appendix testes bilaterally.  No testis necrosis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 300 mL of crystalloid.,TUBES AND DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS: , No tissues sent to pathology.,COUNTS:,  Sponges and needle counts were correct x2.,INDICATIONS OF OPERATION: , The patient is a 4-year-old boy with abrupt onset of left testicular pain.  He has had a history of similar onset.  Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered.  The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity.  There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.  The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine.  The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nDoes the patient have any known allergies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The medical report does not mention any known allergies for the patient."}]}

It is usually located right under the breast bone.  Physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on.  In a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled.  In a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn't get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles).  Other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia.  People more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.,*  The pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.,*  Possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.,*  Occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.,*  Pain may be located between the shoulder blades.,TREATMENT:,*  Nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds.  Carry it with you at all times.,*  Other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems.  It is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.,*  Surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.,*  Correct the contributing factors you have control over.  Lose weight, don't smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina.  Such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren't a risk).  Practice relaxation techniques.,*  Exercise! Discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.,*  Even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat.  Treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.,*  Let your doctor know if your angina doesn't go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet.  Call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps.  If your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.\n\nIs there any mention of family medical history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the text mentions that individuals with a family history of coronary artery disease are more likely to have angina."}]}

The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.,The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the \"Scotty Dog,\" After obtaining the \"Scotty Dog\" view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.,The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the \"Scotty Dog\" technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.\n\nWhat medications is the patient currently taking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient received IV sedation with Versed (a benzodiazepine) and Fentanyl (an opioid) during the procedure.

The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure.,Upon examination and dissection of the conjunctiva superiorly, a scleral rupture was found. The rupture extended approximately 15 mm in length superior to the cornea, approximately 2 mm from the limbus in a horizontal fashion. There was also a rupture at the limbus, near the middle of this laceration, causing the anterior chamber to be flat. There was a large blood clot filling the anterior chamber. An attempt was made to wash out the anterior chamber with BSS on a cannula. The BSS was injected through the limbal rupture, which communicated with the anterior chamber. The blood clot did not move. It was extremely adherent to the iris.,At that time, the rupture that involved the limbus from approximately 10:30 until 12 o'clock was closed using 1 suture of 10-0 nylon. The scleral laceration was then closed using 10 interrupted sutures with 9-0 Vicryl. At that time, the anterior chamber was formed and appeared to be fairly deep. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The knots were rotated posteriorly and the conjunctiva was draped up over the sutures and sewn into position at the limbus using four 7-0 Vicryl sutures, 2 nasally and 2 temporally.

We placed him on Adderall, first time he has been on a stimulant medication last month.  Mother said the next day, he had a wonderful improvement, and he has been doing very well with the medicine.  She has two concerns.  It seems like first thing in the morning after he takes the medicine and it seems like it takes a while for the medicine to kick in.  It wears off about 2 and they have problems in the evening with him.  He was initially having difficulty with his appetite but that seems to be coming back but it is more the problems early in the morning after he takes this medicine than in the afternoon when the thing wears off.  His teachers have seen a dramatic improvement and she did miss a dose this past weekend and said he was just horrible.

He was 49 pounds, but otherwise, fairly well controlled, not all that active in the exam room.  Physical exam itself was deferred today because he has otherwise been very healthy.,ASSESSMENT:,  At this point is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, doing fairly well with the Adderall.,PLAN:,  Discussed with mother two options.  Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.

Orthopedics was planning on taking the patient back for serial debridements and need for reliable IV access is requested.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was obtained by the patient and her daughter.  All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After landmarks were identified, approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcuticular tissues and the right neck posterior head of the sternocleidomastoid.  Locator needle was used to correctly cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  Multiple attempts were made and the right internal jugular vein was unable to be cannulized.,Therefore, we prepared for a right subclavian approach.  The angle of the clavicle was found and a #22 gauge needle was used to anesthetize approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in skin and subcuticular tissues along with the periosteum of the clavicle.  A Cook catheter needle was then placed and ________ the clavicle in the orientation aimed toward the sternal notch.  The right subclavian vein was then accessed.  A guidewire was placed with a Cook needle and then the needle was subsequently removed and a #11 blade scalpel was used to nick the skin.  A dilator sheath was placed over the guidewire and subsequently removed.  The triple lumen catheter was then placed over the guidewire and advanced to 14 cm.  All ports aspirated and flushed.  Good blood return was noted and all ports were flushed well.  The triple lumen catheter was then secured at 14 cm using #0 silk suture.  A sterile dressing was then applied.

Rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body, prolonged procedure taking two hours to remove the stent piecemeal in a very difficult and trying situation.,2.  Excision of granulation tissue tumor.,3.  Bronchial dilation with a balloon bronchoplasty, right main bronchus.,4.  Argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding in the trachea.,5.  Placement of a tracheal and bilateral bronchial stents with a silicon wire stent.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Proximal trachea with high-grade occlusion blocking approximately 90% of the trachea due to granulation tissue tumor and break down of metallic stent.,3.  Multiple stent fractures in the mid portion of the trachea with granulation tissue.,4.  High-grade obstruction of the right main bronchus by stent and granulation tissue.,5.  Left main bronchus was covered by the distal portion of the stent and was only being ventilated through the struts of the stent.,6.  All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the recovery room extubated.\n\nWhat medical condition is the patient being treated for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient is being treated for severe airway stenosis complicated by a malfunctioning self-expanding metallic stent. This condition led to high-grade airway obstruction involving the trachea, carina, and both main bronchi, with additional complications from granulation tissue and fractured stent material.

There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  The liver margin and bowel appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 7 cm.,The cervix was serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A #20 Hank dilator was left in place.  The sterile speculum was then removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision was reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine was injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.

She had had a previous PD catheter placed, but it became infected and had to be removed.  She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified.  A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity.  The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision.  A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire.  At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter.  The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia.  The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site.  The catheter was then connected and two runs of a 150 mL of fluid were made with a good inflow and a good clear return.  The skin was closed with 5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.

An additional drop of tetracaine was instilled in the eye, and then a lid speculum was inserted.,The eye was rotated downward and a crescent blade used to make an incision at the limbus.  This was then dissected forward approximately 1 mm, and then a keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was filled with 1% preservative-free lidocaine and the lidocaine was then replaced with Provisc.  A cystotome was used to make a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis, and then the capsular flap was removed with the Utrata forceps.  The lens nucleus was hydrodissected using BSS on a cannula and then removed using the phaco.  This was aided by cracking the lens nucleus with McPherson forceps.  The remaining cortex was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The capsular bag was then polished with the I&A on capsular bag.  The bag was inflated using viscoelastic and then the wound extended slightly with a keratome.  A folding posterior chamber lens was inserted and rotated into position using McPherson forceps.  The I&A was then placed in the eye again and the remaining viscoelastic removed.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  TobraDex drops were instilled in the eye and a shield was placed over it.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to recovery in good condition.\n\nPlease provide the patient's address and date of birth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

An echocardiogram from 09/13/2007 demonstrated a 3.8-mm patent ductus arteriosus with restrictive left-to-right shunt.  There is mild left atrial chamber enlargement with an LA/AO ratio of 1.821.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with possible left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for device closure of a ductus arteriosus.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures up to the branch pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated a small, type A patent ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  Minimal diameter was approximately 1.6 mm with ampulla diameter of 5.8 mm and length of 6.2 mm.  The wedge catheter could be directed from the main pulmonary artery across the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta.  This catheter exchanged over wire for a 5-French nit-occlude delivery catheter through which a nit-occlude 6/5 flex coil that was advanced and allowed to reconfigure the descending aorta.  Entire system was then brought into the ductal ampulla or one loop of coil was delivered in the main pulmonary artery.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed by fluoroscopy, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic measurements and angiogram in the descending aorta were then repeated approximately 10 minutes following device implantation.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with a slight increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus.  The left-sided heart was fully saturated.  The phasic right-sided and left-sided pressures were normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal and pulmonary flow was slightly increased with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a small conical shaped ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  The branch pulmonary arteries appeared normal.  There is otherwise a normal left aortic arch.,Following coil embolization of the ductus arteriosus, there is no change in mixed venous saturation.  No evidence of residual left-to-right shunt.  There is no change in right-sided pressures.  There is a slight increase in the left-sided phasic pressures.  Calculated systemic flow was unchanged from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta showed a majority of coil mass to be within the ductal ampulla with minimal protrusion in the descending aorta as well as the coil in the main pulmonary artery.  There is a trace residual shunt through the center of coil mass.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:, Patent ductus arteriosus.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus.,MANAGEMENT:  ,The case to be discussed at Combined Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.  The patient will require a cardiologic followup in 6 months and 1 year's time including clinical evaluation and echocardiogram.

Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus.,2.  Tethered brachial artery, left elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital.  A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE: , After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner.  Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly.  Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out.  The elbow was hyperflexed.  Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve.  The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally.  Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital.  He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally.  This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler.  A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler.  Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______.  A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery.  Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this.  I then came back in and then we proceeded.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery.  There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally.  Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position.  He was splinted posteriorly.  Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites.  K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above.  There is concern for growth plate disturbance.  He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome.,A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning.  There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function.\n\nPlease provide the patient's address and date of birth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside.  Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic.  He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires.  He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia.  Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision.  Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted.  There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity.  Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest.  Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation.  This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures.  An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis.  No other sites of bleeding were identified.  The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution.  Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube.  The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures.

The nipple inframammary fold distance is approximately 1.5 cm shorter than the fuller right breast.  The patient has bilateral Mentor-Smooth round moderate projection jell-filled mammary prosthesis, 225 cc.,The patient was marked in the upright position for mobilization of lateral skin flaps and increase in the length of the nipple inframammary fold distance.  She was then brought to the operating room and after satisfactory LMA anesthesia had been induced, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manger.  The patient received a gram of Kefzol prior to beginning the procedure.  The previous inverted T-scar was excised down to the underlying capsule of the breast implant.  The breast was carefully dissected off of the underlying capsule.  Care being taken to preserve the vascular supply to the skin and breast flap.  When the anterior portion of the breast was dissected free of the underlying capsule, the posterior aspect of the capsule was then dissected off of the underlying pectoralis muscle.  A posterior incision was made on the backside of the capsule at the proximate middle portion of the capsule and then reflected inferiorly thereby creating a superior based capsular flap.  The lateral aspects of the capsule were then opened and the inferior edge of the capsule was then sutured to the underside of the inframammary flap with 2-0 Monocryl statures.  Care was taken to avoid as much exposure of the implant, as well as damage to the implant.  When the flap had been created and advanced, hemostasis was obtained and the area copiously irrigated with a solution of Bacitracin 50,000 units, Kefzol 1 g, gentamicin 80 mg, and 500 cc of saline.  The lateral skin both medially and laterally were then completely freed and the vertical incision of the inverted T was then extended the 2 cm and sutured with a trifurcation suture of 2-0 Biosyn.  This lengthened the vertical portion of the mastopexy scar to allow for descent of the implant and roundness of the inferior pole of the left breast.  The remainder of the inverted T was closed with interrupted sutures of 3 and 2-0 Biosyn and the skin was closed with continuous suture of 5-0 nylon.  Bacitracin and a standard breast dressing were applied.,The anesthesia was terminated and the patient was recovered in the operating room.  Sponge, instrument, needle count reported as corrected.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement.  He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.  There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally.  This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior.  The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions.  The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge.

It often appears like a window that is fogged with steam.,WHAT CAUSES CATARACT FORMATION?,*  Aging, the most common cause.,*  Family history.,*  Steroid use.,*  Injury to the eye.,*  Diabetes.,*  Previous eye surgery.,*  Long-term exposure to sunlight.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A CATARACT?,*  The best way for early detection is regular eye examinations by your medical eye doctor. There are many causes of visual loss in addition to the cataract such as problems involving the optic nerve and retina.  If these other problems exist, cataract removal may not result in the return or improvement of vision.  Your eye doctor can tell you how much improvement in vision is likely.,DOES IT TAKE A LONG TIME FOR A CATARACT TO FORM?,Cataract development varies greatly between patients and is affected by the cause of the cataract.  Generally, cataracts progress gradually over many years.  Some people, especially diabetics and younger patients, may find that cataract formation progresses rapidly over a few months making it impossible to know exactly how long it will take for the cataract to develop. ,WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS?,The only way to remove a cataract is surgery.  If the symptoms are not restricting your activity, a change of glasses may alleviate the symptoms at this time.  No medications, exercise, optical devices or dietary supplements have been shown to stop the progression or prevent cataracts.,It is important to provide protection from excessive sunlight.  Making sure that the sunglasses you wear screen out ultraviolet (UV) light rays or your regular eyeglasses are coated with a clear, anti-UV coating will help prevent or slow the progression of cataracts.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED SURGERY?,Surgery is considered when your vision is interfering with your daily activities.  It is important to evaluate if you can see to do your job and drive safely.  Can you read and watch TV in comfort? Are you able to cook, do your shopping and yard work or take your medications without difficulty? Depending on how you feel your vision is affecting your daily life, you and your eye doctor will decide together when it is the appropriate time to do surgery.,WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH CATARACT SURGERY?,This surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.  With the assistance of a microscope, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens implant.,Right after the surgery you should be able to immediately perform all your normal activities except for the most strenuous ones.  You will need to take eye drops as directed by your eye doctor.  Follow-up visits are necessary to make sure the surgical site is healing without problems.,This procedure is performed on over 1.4 million people each year in the United States alone, 95% without complications.  With this highly successful procedure, 90% of the time vision improves unless a problem also exists with the cornea, retina or optic nerve.  As with any surgery, a good result cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWhat medications is the patient currently taking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The document does not mention any current medications that the patient is taking."}]}

Steroid injection, stenosing tenosynovitis of right middle finger.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , Left upper extremity was 15 minutes.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.

The uterus appeared to be intact.  This patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian female.  The patient is well known to the OB/GYN clinic.  The patient had two previous C-sections.  She appears to be in probably early labor.  She had an amniocentesis early today.  She is contracting regularly about every three minutes.  The contractions are painful and getting much more so since the amniocentesis.  The patient had fetal lung maturity noted.  The patient also has probable IUGR as none of her babies have been over 4 lb.  The patient's baby appears to be somewhat small.  The patient suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which has left her wheelchair bound.  The patient has had a spinal fusion, however, family planning is definitely complete per the patient.  The patient refuses trial labor.  The patient and I discussed the consent.  She understands the foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment of the procedure itself, and recovery.  Her questions were answered.  The patient also understands that when we occlude her tube that she is at risk for failure of this part of the procedure, which would result in either an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy.  The patient understands this and would like to try our best.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  She was given general anesthetic by Department of Anesthesiology.  Once again, in layman's terms, the patient understands the risks.  The patient had the informed consent reviewed and understood.  The patient has had a Pfannenstiel incision, which was slightly bent towards the right side favoring the right side.  The patient had the first knife went through this incision.  The second knife was used to go to the level of fascia.  The fascia was very thin, ruddy in appearance, and with abundant scar tissue.  The fascia was incised.  Following this, we were able to see the peritoneum.  There was really no obvious rectus abdominal muscles noted.  They were very weak, atrophic, and thin.  The patient has the peritoneum tented up.  We entered the abdominal cavity.  The bladder flap was then entered into the anterior abdominal wall and to the underlying area of the fascia.  The bladder flap was then entered into the uterus as well.  There are some bladder adhesions.  We removed these adhesions and we removed the bladder of the fascia.  We dissected the bladder of the lower segment.  We made a small nick on the lower segment.  We were able to utilize the blunt end of the knife to enter into the uterine cavity.  The baby was in occiput transverse position with the ear being cocked at such a position as well.  The patient's baby was delivered without difficulty.  It was a 4 lb and 10 oz baby girl who vigorously cried well.  There was a prolapse of the umbilical cord just below the chin as well and this may be attributed to the decelerations we caught on the monitor strip right before we decided to have her undergo resection.  The patient's placenta was delivered.  There was no retained placenta.  The uterine incision was closed with two layers of #0 Vicryl, the second layer imbricating over the first.  The patient on the right side had the inferior epigastric artery and the vein just underneath the peritoneum easily visualized.  Then we ligated this as there was bleeding and oozing.  The patient had the Indigo Carmine instilled into the bladder with some saline about 300 cc.  The 400 cc was instilled.  The bladder appears to be intact.  The bladder did require extensive dissection of the fascia in order to be able to get a proper fascial edges for closure and dissection of the lower uterine segment.  There was some oozing around the area of the bladder.  We placed an Avitene there.  The two Hulka clips were placed perpendicular to going across each fallopian tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient has two clips on each side.  There was excellent tubal occlusion and placement.  The uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity.  We rechecked again.  The tubal placement was excellent.  It did not involve the round ligaments, uterosacral ligaments, the uteroovarian ligaments, and the tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient then underwent further examination.  Hemostasis appeared to be good.  The fascia was reapproximated with short running intervals of #0 Vicryl across the fascia.  We took care not to get into any bleeders and to make sure that the fascia was indeed closed as best as it was possible.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  The skin was reapproximated then as well via subcutaneous closure.  The patient's sponge and needle counts found to be correct.  Uterus appeared to be normal prior to closure.  Bladder appeared to be normal.  The patient's blood loss is 600 cc.\n\nWhat is the treatment plan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The treatment plan for this patient included a repeat low transverse cesarean section due to multiple factors such as early labor, history of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, prior spinal fusion, and refusal of trial labor. Additional procedures included lysis of adhesions, dissection of the bladder from the anterior abdominal wall and fascia due to adhesions, and a bilateral tubal occlusion using Hulka clips for permanent sterilization. An Indigo Carmine dye test confirmed bladder integrity post-surgery. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and had an estimated blood loss of 600 cc. Postoperative care will involve routine monitoring, wound healing, and follow-up to assess recovery."}]}

Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition.\n\nWhat is the patient's name?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.

Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications.\n\nCan you provide identifying details for this patient?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cannot provide personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth from medical records.
